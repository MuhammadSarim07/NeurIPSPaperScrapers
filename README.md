## 🛠️ **Setup & Requirements**  



#### **2️⃣ Install Required Libraries**  
The following Python libraries are required to run the scraper:
- `aiohttp`: For asynchronous HTTP requests.
- `asyncio`: For handling asynchronous tasks.
- `aiofiles`: For asynchronous file handling.
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests.

You can install all the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:


**pip install aiohttp asyncio aiofiles beautifulsoup4 requests**







### **Java Setup & Installation**



After installation, confirm that Java is installed correctly by running the following command:


java -version
